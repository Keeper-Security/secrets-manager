# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `update_secret` now correctly encrypts record data before sending to server
- `update_secret` now calls `finalize_secret_update` endpoint to persist changes
- Local record's revision number is automatically refreshed after successful update
- Consecutive updates on the same record object now work without manual refetching
- `download_file` now properly respects SSL certificate verification settings and disables CRL checking
- `upload_file` now uses correct `add_file` endpoint and includes required `ownerRecordRevision` in payload
- `create_folder` now properly encrypts folder key with AES-CBC and sets correct parent_uid (nil for root-level folders)
- Fixed AES-CBC encryption to not double-pad data (OpenSSL handles padding automatically)
