## Python

Due the structure of the repository, Python testing might not be able to find all the modules. You can add the following
to PYTHONPATH

* sdk/python/core
* integration/keeper\_secrets\_manager\_cli
* integration/keeper\_secrets\_manager\_ansible/module

Or in IDE like PyCharm, you can add those directories as Source Folders in the Project Structure.
