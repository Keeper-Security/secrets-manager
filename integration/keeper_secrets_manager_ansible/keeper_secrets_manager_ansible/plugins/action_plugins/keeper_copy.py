module: keeper_copy

short_description: Copy a Keeper vault secret to the remote server.

version_added: "1.0.0"

description:
    - Copy a file or value from the Keeper Vault to the remote server.
    - Can use Keeper notation or separate uid, field type, and file/field to specify the record.
    - Has the same options at the normal Ansible copy module.
author:
    - John Walstra
options:
  uid:
    description:
    - The UID of the Keeper Vault record.
    type: str
    required: no
  field:
    description:
    - The label, or type, of the standard field in record that contains the value.
    - If the value has a complex value, use notation to get the specific value from the complex value.
    type: str
    required: no
  custom_field:
    description:
    - The label, or type, of the user added customer field in record that contains the value.
    - If the value has a complex value, use notation to get the specific value from the complex value.
    type: str
    required: no
  file:
    description:
    - The file name of the file that contains the value.
    type: str
    required: no
  notation:
    description:
    - The Keeper notation to access record that contains the value.
    - Use notation when you want a specific value.
    - See https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/keeper-notation for more information/
    type: str
    required: no
    version_added: '1.0.1'  
  dest:
    description:
    - Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to.
    - If C(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too.
    - If C(dest) is a non-existent path and if either C(dest) ends with "/" or C(src) is a directory, C(dest) is created.
    - If I(dest) is a relative path, the starting directory is determined by the remote host.
    - If C(src) and C(dest) are files, the parent directory of C(dest) is not created and the task fails if it does not already exist.
    type: path
    required: yes
  backup:
    description:
    - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
  force:
    description:
    - Influence whether the remote file must always be replaced.
    - If C(yes), the remote file will be replaced when contents are different than the source.
    - If C(no), the file will only be transferred if the destination does not exist.
    - Alias C(thirsty) has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.13.
    type: bool
    default: yes
    aliases: [ thirsty ]
  mode:
    description:
    - The permissions of the destination file or directory.
    - For those used to C(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers.
      You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number
      (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string
      and can do its own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without following
      one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
    - As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).
    - As of Ansible 2.3, the mode may also be the special string C(preserve).
    - C(preserve) means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
    - When doing a recursive copy, see also C(directory_mode).
    - If C(mode) is not specified and the destination file B(does not) exist, the default C(umask) on the system will be used
      when setting the mode for the newly created file.
    - If C(mode) is not specified and the destination file B(does) exist, the mode of the existing file will be used.
    - Specifying C(mode) is the best way to ensure files are created with the correct permissions.
      See CVE-2020-1736 for further details.
  directory_mode:
    description:
    - When doing a recursive copy set the mode for the directories.
    - If this is not set we will use the system defaults.
    - The mode is only set on directories which are newly created, and will not affect those that already existed.
    type: raw
  follow:
    description:
    - This flag indicates that filesystem links in the destination, if they exist, should be followed.
    type: bool
    default: no
  local_follow:
    description:
    - This flag indicates that filesystem links in the source tree, if they exist, should be followed.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  checksum:
    description:
    - SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred.
    - Used to validate that the copy of the file was successful.
    - If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated checksum of the src file.
