# Pickle? That's right. For some reason, mocked method protect variable outside of their scope. That means
# if we save a record, there is no way to update the dictionary. Tried multiple ways, whenever the mock method
# is exited the changes are lost. So instead we are going to create a file on disk and we are going to pickle our
# dictionary. When we want to read it, we un-pickle the file. When we want to save it, we pickle and overwrite the
# existing file.
